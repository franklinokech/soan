24/03/2020, 20:10 - Franklin Okech: Finally, some sensible advice.

Good advice from a UK Consultant working with Covid19 in Italy  

‚ÄúWhat I have seen a lot of are recommendations for how to try to avoid getting coronavirus in the first place -- good hand washing, personal hygiene and social distancing -- but what I have NOT seen a lot of is advice for what happens if you actually get it, which many of us will. So as your friendly neighborhood Nurse let me make some suggestions:

You basically just want to prepare as though you know you‚Äôre going to get a nasty respiratory bug, like bronchitis or pneumonia. You just have the foresight to know it might come your way!

Things you should actually buy ahead of time (not sure what the obsession with toilet paper is?):
Kleenex,
Paracetamol,
whatever your generic, mucus thinning cough medicine of choice is (check the label and make sure you're not doubling up on Paracetamol)
Honey and lemon can work just as well!    
Vick vaporub for your chest is also a great suggestion.

If you don‚Äôt have a humidifier, that would be a good thing to buy and use in your room when you go to bed overnight. (You can also just turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom breathing in the steam).

If you have a history of asthma and you have a prescription inhaler, make sure the one you have isn‚Äôt expired and refill it/get a new one if necessary.

This is also a good time to meal prep: make a big batch of your favorite soup to freeze and have on hand.

Stock up on whatever  your favorite clear fluids are to drink - though tap water is fine you may appreciate some variety!

For symptom management and a fever over 38¬∞c, take Paracetamol rather than Ibuprofen.

Hydrate (drink!) hydrate, hydrate! 
Rest lots. You should not be leaving your house!  Even if you are feeling better you may will still be infectious for fourteen days and older people and those with existing health conditions should be avoided!
Ask friends and family to leave supplies outside to avoid contact.  

You DO NOT NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL unless you are having trouble breathing or your fever is very high (over 39¬∞C) and unmanaged with meds. 90% of healthy adult cases thus far have been managed at home with basic rest/hydration/over-the-counter meds.

If you are worried or in distress or feel your symptoms are getting worse, ring 111 and they will advise if you need to go to hospital.  The hospital beds will be used for people who actively need oxygen/breathing treatments/IV fluids.

If you have a pre-existing lung condition (COPD, emphysema, lung cancer) or are on immunosuppressants, now is a great time to talk to your Doctor or specialist about what they would like you to do if you get sick. 

One major relief to you parents is that kids do VERY well with coronavirus‚Äî they usually bounce back in a few days (but they will still be infectious), Just use pediatric dosing .

Be calm and prepare rationally and everything will be fine.  Share this as it's great advice!"

01/04/2020, 21:46 - Franklin Okech: hehe,,,that has never happened in the history of birthdays
01/04/2020, 21:47 - Franklin Okech: the last birthay i organised was back in campus in Year 4, their was this lady my best friend wanted to surprise with a birthday party so i got involved because of my friend
01/04/2020, 21:48 - Faith Mbodze: Ushwai Fanya yako
01/04/2020, 21:49 - Franklin Okech: ironically no...The last one my friends organised for me did not go well
01/04/2020, 21:49 - Faith Mbodze: Whyüò≥
01/04/2020, 21:55 - Franklin Okech: i could not make it...While i campus, I was doing part time job with some NGO, and by coincidence i went home for a meeting concerning the job...I was very positive i would make it..I begun my journey back to Campus at around 4pm, the party was to start at 7pm...When the vehecle was close to Kisumu, it developed a puncture and had to continue the Journey with a private means...My friends called informing me their was a strike that started at around 7pm apparently some student was killed by the villagers...I had intentions of reaching the campus and took a matatu to Maseno amid the demostration...I arrived at the main gate at around 8pm and found Policemen everywhere and a curfew was issued out that no student should be seen outside...I went into the campus premised so could not make it to my party which was organised outside the university hostels
01/04/2020, 21:56 - Franklin Okech: I was one of the dispointing moments at campus
01/04/2020, 21:56 - Faith Mbodze: Too bad pole sana
01/04/2020, 21:58 - Franklin Okech: the cake however saved us the following day as the strike continued..We met and ate whatever remained...Policemen were going house to house beating rrioting students...When they came where we were they almost beat us but offered them the remaining cake to spare us some beatings
01/04/2020, 22:00 - Faith Mbodze: Hehehe so they ate and left you
01/04/2020, 22:01 - Franklin Okech: yes,,,because of the cake...it was well baked...Their is this lady from the coast, she really worked on the cake...We told the policemen we are not rioting just having a birthday and they asked for the cake as proof...
01/04/2020, 22:01 - Franklin Okech: we gave them and they left us unbeaten
01/04/2020, 22:02 - Faith Mbodze: He he mlihonga
01/04/2020, 22:02 - Franklin Okech: hizo rungu zao sipendi nichapwe nayo

01/04/2020, 22:06 - Faith Mbodze: Nmeacha
01/04/2020, 22:07 - Franklin Okech: i guess i gave them something to remember me with,,,'the guy who failed to show up in his own birthday party'
01/04/2020, 22:08 - Faith Mbodze: Very funny
01/04/2020, 22:10 - Franklin Okech: i did however sponsor them for an out from them from the money i got from the part time job...we went out away from the campus to some really nice swimming pool...They are no longer angry at me
01/04/2020, 22:11 - Faith Mbodze: At least waah .the guy who missed his birthday party
01/04/2020, 22:15 - Franklin Okech: And the lady from the coast, who made the nice cake,,,when the university was indefinately close, i offered to take her home so she didn't to incur costs of travelling back to coast...we didn't know when university could open...You just know the villagers will always ask quetions...I only had one person to explain the situation to: My mum...
01/04/2020, 22:16 - Franklin Okech: so i repaid all my bad deeds
01/04/2020, 22:17 - Faith Mbodze: So nice of you.what about your dadüò≥

02/04/2020, 21:49 - Faith Mbodze: And I broke some bodies heart but for good will ,I just told him let's end the relationship it was not an easy thing to do but I was protecting myself
02/04/2020, 21:56 - Franklin Okech: Yes,  I guess people don't just decide to end relationship,,, it's takes a lot of soul searching...If you don't click with someone, it's good to cut them loose before things becomes complicated...I did end one relationship once in 2018, it was difficult choice but it was in our best interest,,,Then 2019, the reverse happened, I was the victim,, the lady did get a job at Colorado and was to fly abroad and I got a job at kilifi and was to relocate to coast,,,she felt it won't work in that set up
02/04/2020, 21:57 - Faith Mbodze: Colorado niwapi
02/04/2020, 21:57 - Franklin Okech: It's in the US,
02/04/2020, 21:58 - Faith Mbodze: Hio ya Us waah
02/04/2020, 22:01 - Franklin Okech: Shw did say she would stay for one year then back to Kenya, so I felt it was not a big deal, apparently she has her own plans,,,she did bid me bye at Nairobi stage while coming for Komaza day ,,, then break with me over text while I was enroute to Mombasa...
02/04/2020, 22:02 - Faith Mbodze: üò≥üò≥üò≥too bad
02/04/2020, 22:03 - Faith Mbodze: Hio inauma sana
02/04/2020, 22:04 - Franklin Okech: I just went to makuti villas and slept through the weekend.. I don't how I still got confidence to face the panel
02/04/2020, 22:05 - Faith Mbodze: God works miraculously
02/04/2020, 22:06 - Franklin Okech: At least in 2018 I took the lady for lunch and ended things in a more civilized way...
02/04/2020, 22:07 - Faith Mbodze: The 2019 one is the one who went to US
02/04/2020, 22:07 - Franklin Okech: When I saw the next, I just replied,,,'Okay, that hurts'.  Never spoke with her again...
02/04/2020, 22:07 - Franklin Okech: Yes
02/04/2020, 22:07 - Faith Mbodze: Up to now
02/04/2020, 22:09 - Franklin Okech: She did block me on WhatsApp,,, which I didn't understand why...
02/04/2020, 22:09 - Faith Mbodze: Wah wah wah pole
02/04/2020, 22:11 - Faith Mbodze: I broke  up with one of my ex which I used to love the most 2018.and I have never talked to him ,I have not blocked him but I don't receive his calls or SMS I don't reply, he broke my heart sana
02/04/2020, 22:14 - Franklin Okech: I guess this blocking strategy works,,, but I think she recently unblock me,,, I saw her update she has 13 days for quarantine.. I don't know whether she is back or what,,, didn't bother to ask
02/04/2020, 22:15 - Faith Mbodze: Okay. Afadhali yako.mine was a hell
02/04/2020, 22:15 - Franklin Okech: Am sorry, love hurts alot
02/04/2020, 22:15 - Faith Mbodze: Mimi ata nikimuona kwa njia simsalimii walai
02/04/2020, 22:16 - Franklin Okech: You should just say hi, at least once upon a time, they were the source of your happiness
02/04/2020, 22:17 - Faith Mbodze: Hehe me I can't. Let me tell you what he did ndio utaelewa
02/04/2020, 22:18 - Franklin Okech: Ali do?
02/04/2020, 22:21 - Faith Mbodze: This guy was my boyfriend from 2017 we broke up early 2019. He used to be nice doing things together he used to work Mombasa ,he would come pick me almost every weekend the bond was tight for two years everything was going on well.until when I discover he had a wife and two kids
02/04/2020, 22:23 - Faith Mbodze: And I don't know how he managed to keep the secret. But it pained me when I knew
02/04/2020, 22:26 - Franklin Okech: Men, men, men... That's is unforgivable.... first this is someone who lied to you, meaning that is someone who can kill in my opinion..
02/04/2020, 22:27 - Faith Mbodze: He saw me last month at tuskeys he greated me and I never responded ,he was like let's talk and I told him I don't know you
02/04/2020, 22:29 - Franklin Okech: Their is really nothing to discuss, did you have tangible proof?
02/04/2020, 22:31 - Faith Mbodze: Yea.
02/04/2020, 22:31 - Faith Mbodze: I was shocked coz he use to go to his home ocha but no signs he could talk to me as normal
02/04/2020, 22:33 - Franklin Okech: Mgiriama?
02/04/2020, 22:33 - Faith Mbodze: Until one day his wife or I don't know girlfriend called me.worst thing that I hated from him was that he used to give me everything chenye nataka but he never provided for his family
02/04/2020, 22:35 - Franklin Okech: May he did truly loved, didn't just know how to start,,,worst case, he was a player who just wanted someone on the side...in either cases, he lied which makes him dangerous
02/04/2020, 22:36 - Faith Mbodze: Mi ata simsalimii naona tu text zake nikiziangalia tu
02/04/2020, 22:37 - Faith Mbodze: I hate lies afadhali uniambie ukweli then I will decide on my own
02/04/2020, 22:39 - Franklin Okech: For honesty is the number one thing I look for,,,if something don't add up to me, I do my digging until it makes sense,,, I like telling people bitter truths than pamper them with lies...
02/04/2020, 22:40 - Faith Mbodze: Love things zina wenyewd
02/04/2020, 22:40 - Faith Mbodze: *wenyewe
02/04/2020, 22:43 - Franklin Okech: Hehe,,, on your end you did love him, that's good, it proves you are human... He wasn't very straightforward with you during the initial stages of the relationship, because that should have come out,,,so he just told you, 'you know am single'
02/04/2020, 22:45 - Faith Mbodze: Yea aliniambia ako single.he he acha tu nicheke this story is funny
02/04/2020, 22:47 - Franklin Okech: Hehe,,, that hurts
02/04/2020, 22:47 - Faith Mbodze: But mwengine nilimuacha mimiü§£ü§£but ulikua for my own good
02/04/2020, 22:48 - Franklin Okech: Karma will come for you ü§£
02/04/2020, 22:50 - Franklin Okech: But generally sometimes you got to put your needs and wants above everything, especially anything that compromise your happiness
02/04/2020, 22:51 - Faith Mbodze: He used to love me with a lot of wivu and I was not happy coz he employed a spy to follow me everywhere I go.just imagine that and he was a short tempered person so I thought he can even hurt me one day
02/04/2020, 22:54 - Franklin Okech: Seems like he had trust issues... You probably liked going out with your male friends and maybe he didn't like that. He should learn to trust those he loves
02/04/2020, 22:55 - Franklin Okech: Aki si umepitia Mingo kwa love scenes
02/04/2020, 22:55 - Franklin Okech: Mingi
02/04/2020, 22:57 - Faith Mbodze: I have so many friends not even going out,talking with a male person was a problem to him
02/04/2020, 22:58 - Faith Mbodze: He cried when I left him ,his parents talked to me but I said no.he was depressed for some time but he is now okey ata ni best friend yangu sana
02/04/2020, 22:59 - Franklin Okech: Very sad moment in a man's life...
02/04/2020, 22:59 - Faith Mbodze: I couldn't stand being unhappy everyday na kujamiwa daily and being followed
02/04/2020, 23:01 - Faith Mbodze: Alikua mmeru.SAA hii I can't date a meru never
02/04/2020, 23:03 - Franklin Okech: Your happiness should be your priority in life,,, that's one of my rules, if something or someone makes me question my happiness then it that someone or something that should be cut... I generally try to make other people happy , sometimes you get strained and can't make everyone happy and has to make tough sacrifices.
02/04/2020, 23:03 - Faith Mbodze: Yea.
02/04/2020, 23:06 - Franklin Okech: I really do care for those I love and would go extra miles to make them happy and the expense of my happiness... The things we do for love
